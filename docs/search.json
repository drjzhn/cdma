These problems, and many others, get in the way of clinical work, and are a risk to quality and safety of care.\nThe Clinician Digital Maturity Assessment (cDMA) was designed by clinicians to measure experiences and pain points of EHR from the shop floor perspective.\nIt is designed for any clinical worker (e.g.¬†doctor, nurse, pharmacist, AHP) in primary care and hospitals.\nThe results will be used to drive improvement in clinical software and IT.\nTake the cDMA Survey!"

    "text": "There are so many surveys, why should I take this one?\nYes, you are right. There are far too many surveys, and they take far too long. But we would really appreciate it if you did this one. Here is why:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour voice will be heard. We are supported by the British Medical Association (BMA), the Health Foundation, and have direct channels open to the Care Quality Commission (CQC), the Health Safety Services Investigation Body (HSSIB), and to NHS England.\nIt was designed by 150 of your clinician colleagues through workshops and a national study to accurately reflect frontline experiences\nIt takes 8 minutes (we‚Äôve tried it!).\nThe survey is anonymous, but unlike many official NHS surveys, data will be open source for analysis. The state of our IT should be public information."

But NHS digital assessments have always measured from the top down, from the perspective of managers, IT, and software suppliers.\nThat‚Äôs why we developed this survey, together with more than 150 clinicians (doctors, nurses, pharmacists) across the UK. This survey will measure the major problems and pain points with EHR from the perspective of those working on the ‚Äòshop floor‚Äô.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‚è≥ I lose hours every week because our computer systems are ‚Äòdown‚Äô\nüïò I stay late at work most days because the computers are slow\nüíª I can‚Äôt look after a patient because there are no working laptops on the ward"

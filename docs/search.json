These problems, and many others, get in the way of clinical work, and are a risk to quality and safety of care.\nThe Clinician Digital Maturity Assessment (cDMA) was designed by clinicians to measure experiences and pain points of EHR from the shop floor perspective.\nThe cDMA is designed for any clinical worker (e.g. doctor, nurse, pharmacist, AHP) in primary care and hospitals.\nThe results will be used to drive improvement in clinical software and IT.\nTake the cDMA Survey!"

But we would really appreciate it if you did this one. Here is why:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour voice will be heard. We are supported by the British Medical Association (BMA), the Health Foundation, and have direct channels open to the Care Quality Commission (CQC), the Health Safety Services Investigation Body (HSSIB), and to NHS England\nIt was designed by 150 of your clinician colleagues through workshops and a national study to accurately reflect frontline experiences\nIt takes 8 minutes (we’ve tried it!)\nThe survey is anonymous and data and results will be available to anyone who wants to analyse it for free. We hope that this will help you to advocate for change in your local area"

In the intervening time, our team has made a monumental effort to unite this survey with existing NHS England What Good Looks Like. While there has been excellent engagement, we could not find an agreement that would result in (1) publicly available results, and (2) mapping of all the problem areas that we know exist.\nAs a result, with the support of the British Medical Assoiation, we have launched this as a grassroots initiative."
